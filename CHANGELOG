Changelog

All notable changes to BuffMonitor will be documented in this file.

The project follows a pragmatic versioning approach focused on stability and compatibility with Project Lazarus, rather than strict semantic versioning.

[1.4.3] – Stable Release
Controller-safe execution and duplicate report fix
Added

Controller-local buff checking to guarantee consistent self-reporting

Batched buff checks using a single E3 broadcast

Optional Only report MISSING buffs setting

Persistent configuration for:

Buff list

Enabled/disabled state

User options

Changed

Switched E3 broadcast command from /e3bcga to /e3bcg

Ensures responder scripts execute on group members excluding the controller

Eliminates duplicate controller output

Consolidated buff checks into a single responder execution per toon

Improved output clarity while minimizing group chat noise

Fixed

Intermittent controller non-reporting caused by MQNext Lua concurrency behavior

Duplicate controller output when combining local checks with E3 execution

Race conditions caused by self-targeted E3 broadcasts

Notes

This version represents the intended final architecture:

Controller performs authoritative self-check

Group members respond via short-lived responder scripts

No background agents

No reliance on group-wide visibility assumptions

[1.4.0 – 1.4.2] – Iteration and Refinement
Added

Batched buff checking support

User-selectable output suppression for ACTIVE buffs

Improved persistence handling

Changed

Refined responder argument parsing

Improved ImGui state handling for Lazarus compatibility

Fixed

Checkbox state snapping caused by Lazarus ImGui return semantics

Unintended state mutation inside render loops

[1.3.0] – Batched Responder Support
Added

Support for checking multiple buffs in a single responder execution

Reduced E3 command volume

Changed

Reworked driver-to-agent communication to use delimited payloads

[1.2.x] – Persistence and UI Stability
Added

Persistent saved buff list

Enable/disable toggle per buff

Explicit save controls

Fixed

Buff list wiping caused by InputText buffer behavior

Checkbox state instability in Lazarus ImGui

[1.0.0] – Initial Release
Added

Basic buff monitoring via group queries

Simple ImGui interface

Agent-based buff checking

Design Summary

BuffMonitor intentionally:

Avoids persistent background monitoring

Uses explicit remote execution via E3

Performs buff checks locally on each toon

Minimizes ImGui complexity for Lazarus stability

This approach ensures reliable behavior across zoning, relogs, and MacroQuest restarts.
